apache2 (2.2.9-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * The directive "NameVirtualHost *" has been changed to "NameVirtualHost
    *:80". It has also been moved from sites-available/default to ports.conf.
    This allows to ship a proper SSL default virtual host config in
    sites-available/default-ssl, but it means that if you use several name
    based virtual hosts:
    
    - you will have to change <VirtualHost *> to <VirtualHost *:80> in your
      name based virtual hosts

    - you need to add more NameVirtualHost directives if you use other ports
      than 80 with name based virtual hosts. You may also have to add these
      ports to the default virtual host in /etc/apache2/sites-available/default
      (like this: "<VirtualHost *:80 *:81>").
    
    If you prefer to revert to the old setup instead (and don't need the
    default-ssl host), just change "NameVirtualHost *:80" back to
    "NameVirtualHost *" in ports.conf and "<VirtualHost *:80>" to
    "<VirtualHost *>" in sites-available/default.

  * For mod_disk_cache, caching is again disabled in disk_cache.conf by
    default. It usually makes more sense to enable this on a per-virtual host
    basis.

apache2 (2.2.8-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * The suexec helper program needed for mod_suexec is now shipped in a
    separate package, apache2-suexec, which is not installed by default.
    You need to install this package manually if you are using mod_suexec.

    There is now also the apache2-suexec-custom package, which contains a
    customizable version of suexec which can be used with different document
    roots than /var/www.

apache2 (2.2.8-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * The Apache User and Group and the PidFile path are now configured in
    /etc/apache2/envvars, to make it easier to use them in scripts
    (like the init and logrotate scripts, and apache2ctl).
    If you have changed these settings from their default values, you need to
    adjust /etc/apache2/envvars.
    This also means that starting apache2 with "apache2 -k start" is no longer
    possible, you have to use /etc/init.d/apache2 or apache2ctl.

apache2 (2.2.4-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * This version introduces some changes in the configuration layout and
    defaults. You will probably have to adjust your configuration accordingly.

    - Module specific configuration has been moved from 
      /etc/apache2/apache2.conf to /etc/apache2/mods-available/*.conf for the
      following modules: 
        actions          alias              autoindex
        info             mime               negotiation
        setenvif         status

    - AddDefaultCharset is again disabled by default. See
      /etc/apache2/conf.d/charset

    - "Listen 443" is automatically enabled in /etc/apache2/ports.conf if
      mod_ssl is enabled.

  * The NO_START functionality from /etc/default/apache2 has been removed. If
    you don't want to start apache2 on boot, rename the S*apache2 start
    symlinks as usual.

  * To ensure that the disk cache does not grow indefinitely, htcacheclean is
    now started when mod_disk_cache is enabled. The details can be configured
    in /etc/default/apache2 .
